STATE::

State is a representation of all the data in the app.
    -Each comp. can have its own state, but think of it as an object that manages all data
    -we have state in our fish, in our order summary, etc. Data is being managed all over

State is essentially a master object, where all data is stored and managed.
    -whenever we want to change data on the page, we edit our state and let react change the HTML for us.
    -this way we don't have to keep track of every single place in the view where a piece of data is being referenced and
     update them individually, we change the data once in react and react updates the view everywhere its referenced.
    
So we created our fish object in AddFishForm. When you click the button a js object is created with all the vlaues of the inputs.

How do we get this object into our state?
    -State is always tied to a specific component, in this case, the <App /> component
    -Each component can have its own state, but a lot of the time you need to share state b/t components
    -In our case we want to share state b/t <Inventory />, <Order />, and <FishList />, which is why its good to store
     state in a parent component such as <App />

First we need to GetInitialState -- react needs to know what to expect, this establishes the groundwork for state
    -we do this by calling a constructor when we initialize our class in the <App /> component
        constructor() {
            super(); // can't use 'this' until we call super.
            this.state = {
                fishes: {},
                order: {}
            }
        }

How does our fish object get from <AddFishForm /> to the state object inside <App /> ?
    -create addFish() method in app that takes one argument, fish.
    -this method needs to update our state and set our state, and react makes us do a few things to make this happen
    -it is best practice to make a copy of your current state and then update your state
        addFish(fish) {
            const fishes = {...this.state.fishes};
        }
    -What is {...this.state.fishes}; ?
        -this is our current state. If we had 6 fishes in our current state, we take those and put them into a new state.
        - ... is a spread. It takes the 6 fishes and spreads them into our object. It basically is taking a copy of our
         current state and puts it into a new state called 'fishes'
    -now we add in our new fish. And we'll use a timestamp as our key so that its unique and incremental and we can easily order
     the items in the state object.
        addFish(fish) {
            // update our current state
            const fishes = {...this.state.fishes};

            // add new fish
            const timestamp = Date.now();
            fishes[`fish-${timestamp}`] = fish;
        }
    -now we have updated the state object and added our new fish, but the new fish hasn't yet been added to our state.
        -we do this by explicity telling react which state we would like to update
        -we don't want to update our entire state object bc react doesn't want to have to check everything currently in state
         so this isn't a good idea:
            this.setState(state;)
        -instead we can just tell react which part of state changed
            this.setState({ fishes: fishes });
    -now we can test this by manually calling the addFish method in the console
        $r.addFish({name: "ball fish", price: 5000});
    -then if we look in the react dev tools inside of state we have a new fish.

    -How do we get <AddFishForm />, a child component, up to <App /> ?
        -we do this with props
        -we have the addFish() method on <App /> but how do we call it from a component thats a couple levels deep, from
         <Inventory /> ?
        -In <App /> we are rendering out <Inventory />. So were passing the function down from <App /> to <Inventory />
            -now we can look in react dev tools and in <Inventory /> we can see that addFish() has been passed down in props
    
        *So we have a component <Inventory /> that is being rendered in side of a parent component <App />. In <App />
         we have a method, addFish(), that we need to make available to <Inventory />.
            -we simply place the addFish() method on the <Inventory /> component via props
                <Inventory addFish={this.addFish} />
            -this passes the function down to <Inventory />, making it props on the <Inventory /> component
        *Now addFish() is available to <Inventory /> as props. But we have to go one level deeper to <AddFishForm />, so now
         we can pass addFish() from <Inventory /> to <AddFishForm /> bc addFish() is on <Inventory /> as props.
            -so inside of <Inventory />, we simply render 
                <AddFishForm addFish={this.props.addFish};

        *In React we pass data around via props. We first created props on <Inventory /> via <Inventory addFish={this.addFish} />
            -now since addFish() is part of the props object, any child of <Inventory /> can gain access to the method by doing
                <AddFishForm addFish={this.props.addFish}

    -Lastly, on <AddFishForm />, after we create the new fish object, we can add the fish to state via addFish because we
     passed it to the component via props.
        -Now we can call the function after we create the new fish via
            this.props.addFish(fish);

    *We put addFish() on the <App /> component because that is where we are managing state. We want to have one large state object
     at the parent level. This is why we didn't put the addFish() method on <Inventory />. We manage state from <App />. 
        -addFish() isn't just adding a fish to some array, it is adding it to STATE, which we manage on the <App /> component.

LOOPING OVER THE OBJECTS INSIDE STATE AND DISPLAYING THEM WITH JSX

-We can use Object.keys() to loop over the fishes object inside of our state object.
    -we can't use .map() initially because .map takes an array, and our fishes are an object
    -But Object.keys(this.state.fishes) returns an array with made up of the keys of each fish value
        ['fish1', 'fish2', etc]
    -Now that we have an array we can loop over it with .map per usual. map() takes an array and then returns a second array

        Object.keys(this.state.fishes).map(key => <Fish />);

    -This will return (=>) a fish component for every key in the array.

    ** the arrow function, => means 'return' **

-This works and our sample fish are looped over and rendered to the screen, however, react yells at us in the console
 saying that each child in an iterator should have a unique key. It says this because without a unique key react doesn't
 know how to update a single fish, bc they all look the same.
    -To fix this we just need to set a key and the key can be anything, including 'key'

        .map(key => <Fish key={key} />);

    -{key} will set the key on the <Fish /> component to the key in the array we looped over from Object.keys(this.state.fishes)
    -Now if we load our sample data and look in our react dev tools we can see all the <Fish /> components that are being
     displayed and they each have a numerical key identical to the key from the sample-fishes.

        <Fish key="fish1"></Fish>
        <Fish key="fish2"></Fish>
        ...

-Now we want the <Fish /> component to actually load the properties on each fish object. We can do this by targeting each
 fish object in the array via the key and place this as props on the <Fish /> component

    <Fish key={key} details={this.state.fishes[key]} />

-Now there are details props under each fish component with all the properties on that fish.

*SUMMARY

To loop over something we first need an array. We get an array through

    Object.keys(this.state.fishes)

Now we can loop over the array with .map(), which can be passed anything, such as a list of keys, and return something else
such as a list of <Fish /> components

    .map(key => <Fish />)

We then attach the proper key and property details to each fish component

    .map(key => <Fish key={key} details{this.state.fishes[key]} />)

...................

Now we can  go into Fish.js and just start writing some HTML.

-We added props to the <Fish /> component via 

    <Fish details={this.state.fishes[key]} />

Now we can access those props and display them via JSX

    <li className="menu-fish">{this.props.details.name}</li>
